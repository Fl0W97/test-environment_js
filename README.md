# Europe Quiz

Welcome to my second project, the Europe quiz website is a landing page for people who like quizzes and are motivated to test or improve their knowledge about European countries.

## Features

### Navigation

The user is able to navigate on the navigation bar. The quiz is the most prominent featuere therefor, it appears already on the landing apge.
There are three navigation elements according to the three pages Quiz, Highscore and About. Due to responsive design requiremets the behaviour and position of the navigation bar is slightly different.

Mobile view: Elements are aligned to the center. burger tab is not used.
s
Tablet view: Elements are aligned to the center. Toggle is not used, hover effect available

Desktop view: Elements are aligned to the center. Toggle is not used, hover effect available. Hover-effect is implemented. 

There are three media query breakpoints used: (320px), 768px, 992px

### The header 
Title and logo are above the navigation. Depending on the media query the header gets bigger. The font-size/size of title and logo increases. The header's height is around XX px, therefore. there is a margin-top value of 97px for the main element.

### The Footer
The footer contains a link to the creator's GitHub and Linkedin link. 


## UX Design
Colorful, plain and simple design. Show a map in the background to introduce the user to the topic - it's geography. The colors of a classic map are used.

 The design was created as a series of wireframes covering mobile, tablet and desktop to determine the initial design and layout of the site.


### Color Scheme
The colors used are mostlly aligned with the background and typical colors used on a map. Blue for water, beige for landscape and red, grey for cities and borders. The text color is dark grey and black to provide a userfriendly contrast.

- backgrounds #ffffff, #fce89a

- water blue: #79c9e7, #a6dbef, #58afd9
- land green #a0cf50, beige #fad27f, brown #c0643d
- accents #
- logo, illustrations #
- font color #252525, #000000 #918e8e

### Typography

- I used the Google Font called ''
- Font Awesome icons were used, for GitHub links in the footer
- further icons/ illustrations used from [Freepik.com ](https://www.freepik.com/) and [Picjumbo.com](https://picjumbo.com/)

## Testing
- Testing was done in small breaks during the development and at the end of the project
- Validators have been used
- small feature checks has been made by using preview and the devtools device toolbar
- Tests are done in different browsers such as Edge, Chrome and Firefox
- Responsivness is tested with different screen sizes by using devtools device toolbar
- navigation, header and content of all subpages is readable and easy to understand
- the audio files are working, the voice is understandable and autoplay is deactivated when the page is opened
